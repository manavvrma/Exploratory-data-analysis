# Zomato Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about restaurants, their locations, cuisines, and user ratings. EDA will help us uncover interesting insights related to geography, restaurant types, and ratings.
